# Slack Integration Database Implementation

## Date: February 20, 2025

### Overview

Implemented a lightweight SQLite-based database solution for managing case information in the Slack integration.

### Key Features

- Case creation and tracking
- Document attachment management
- Hearing scheduling
- Comprehensive case retrieval

### Technical Details

- SQLite as the underlying database engine
- UUID-based unique identifiers
- Flexible schema supporting multiple case-related entities
- Comprehensive test suite

### Implementation Highlights

- Dynamic case number generation
- Metadata tracking for cases, documents, and hearings
- Flexible querying capabilities
- Temporary database support for testing

### Files Modified/Added

- `src/integrations/slack/database.py`: Main database implementation
- `tests/integrations/slack/test_slack_database.py`: Comprehensive test suite
- `src/integrations/slack/README.md`: Documentation for database usage

### Database Schema

- **Cases Table**:
  - Tracks case metadata
  - Generates unique case numbers
  - Stores case status and creation timestamp

- **Documents Table**:
  - Associates documents with specific cases
  - Tracks file metadata (name, type, size)
  - Timestamps document uploads

- **Hearings Table**:
  - Schedules and tracks case hearings
  - Links hearings to specific cases
  - Stores hearing dates and scheduling timestamps

### Testing Results

- All test cases passed successfully
- Validated case creation, document attachment, and hearing scheduling
- Confirmed unique case number generation
- Verified comprehensive case retrieval

### Next Steps

1. Integrate with Slack agent workflows
2. Implement additional query methods
3. Add more advanced filtering capabilities
4. Consider performance optimizations

### Potential Future Improvements

- Add indexing for faster queries
- Implement soft delete functionality
- Create more advanced reporting features
- Support for case status transitions
